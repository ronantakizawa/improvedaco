Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm using a positional-encoded transformer neural network to predict optimal pheromone matrices before running the algorithm. 

The Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm is initialized with  a pheromone matrix outputted by a positional-encoded transformer neural network that was trained on pheromone matrix data from the normal ant colony optimization algorithm.
